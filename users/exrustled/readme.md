# Overview
My user-space code here I'm basically mostly using it for keeping my general layouts for the keyboards that I use (ortho48, minidox, qaz...)
Most of it is a modified (mostly rewritten) version of manna-harbour_miryoku's layout (thank you so much for making such an amazing layout in the first place!!)
